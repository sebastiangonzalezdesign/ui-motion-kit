## [Unreleased]

### Recent Updates (September 2025)

#### Enhanced Motion System Architecture

- **UX-Focused Semantic Motion Roles**: Completely redesigned motion system with semantic mapping to UX goals
  - Added `micro-interaction`, `entrance`, `exit`, `emphasis`, `continuity`, and `feedback` motion roles
  - Clear mapping between motion intent and implementation for better developer experience
  - Follows enterprise design system patterns (Material Design, Atlassian Design System)

- **Professional Easing Curves**: Semantic easing functions with clear UX intent
  - `ease-standard`: General UI transitions with smooth, natural feel
  - `ease-decelerate`: Optimized for entrances and reveals
  - `ease-accelerate`: Perfect for exits and dismissals
  - `ease-spring`: Playful, bouncy interactions for micro-interactions
  - `ease-emphasized`: Strong emphasis for attention-grabbing elements
  - Maintains backward compatibility with legacy aliases

- **Enhanced Motion Documentation**: Comprehensive motion system documentation with live examples
  - Visual demonstrations of each motion role and easing curve
  - Clear usage guidelines for different interaction patterns
  - Implementation examples for common UI scenarios

- **Centralized Motion Tokens**: All motion tokens integrated into `_tokens.scss` following established patterns
  - Duration scale from instant (0ms) to slowest (1000ms)
  - Professional easing curves with semantic naming
  - Consistent architecture across color, typography, spacing, and motion systems

#### Enhanced Token System Architecture

- **Centralized Theme Configuration**: Implemented `$themes` map for single source of truth across all theme variations
  - Eliminates manual duplication between light/dark modes
  - Scales effortlessly to support additional themes (high-contrast, sepia, etc.)
  - Reduces maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies

- **Automatic Theme Generation**: Programmatic theme creation from centralized configuration
  - No more manual dark mode overrides â€” themes generated automatically
  - DRY principle applied with SCSS @each loops for scalable theme management
  - Consistent token application across all theme variants

- **Fixed vs. Contextual Token Separation**:
  - Brand colors remain consistent across all themes for brand identity
  - Contextual tokens (backgrounds, text, borders) adapt appropriately to each theme
  - Clear architectural separation improves maintainability and semantics

#### Enhanced Navigation System

- **Intelligent Breadcrumb Navigation**: Category-aware breadcrumb system with state persistence
  - Automatically maintains category context when navigating back from component pages
  - Uses URL search parameters for reliable state management
  - Maps all components to their respective categories (UI Basics, Navigation, Feedback, Motion)
  - Provides seamless navigation experience across the component library

- **Component Routing Improvements**:
  - Fixed sidebar component routing and display issues
  - Added proper route configuration for all example pages
  - Corrected path mismatches between component definitions and actual files
  - Enhanced component organization with proper exports and imports

- **File Structure Optimization**:
  - Reorganized demo site pages into logical categories (`docs/`, `examples/`)
  - Improved component-to-category mapping for better navigation
  - Fixed missing component files and routing inconsistencies### Phase 2 - Premium Components (In Development)

- Advanced component library (Tabs, Drawers, Toasts, Command Palette)
- Enhanced motion system with scroll-triggered animations
- Storybook documentation with interactive controls
- Multiple theme presets and custom theming system
- Dashboard and landing page templates
- Figma design system integration

### Phase 3 - Cross-Platform Token Evolution (Future Vision)

- **JSON Token Source of Truth**: Evolution from current SCSS foundation to JSON-based tokens
- **Style Dictionary Integration**: Multi-platform token generation (React Native, iOS, Android, Tailwind)
- **Design Tool Integration**: Figma bidirectional sync and Token Studio support
- **Enterprise Features**: Multi-brand token management and automated validation
- **Cross-Platform Toolkit**: Same design tokens across web, mobile, and native platforms

> **Architecture Strategy**: The current sophisticated SCSS token system serves as the foundation for future cross-platform capabilities, ensuring backward compatibility while enabling enterprise-scale token management.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-03
